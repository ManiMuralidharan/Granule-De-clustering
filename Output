Understanding the Output:
The function adds several columns to your data:

AdjustedCount: Estimated number of granules in each object
IsCluster: True/false indicating if the object is a cluster
ClusterConfidence: 0=single granule, 1=medium confidence cluster, 2=high confidence cluster

Typical Workflow:

Determine threshold: Start with a conservative estimate (e.g., 500 if measuring in μm²)
Run analysis: Execute the function with your data
Review visualizations: Check the generated plots for validation
Adjust threshold: If needed, modify the threshold and re-run
Export results: The function automatically saves results to Excel

Example Output:
Processing 150 objects...
Single granule statistics:
  Mean area: 245.67 ± 89.23 (std)
  Median area: 230.45
  Number of single granules: 95

High confidence cluster - Object 15: Area=1200.50, Estimated granules=5
Medium confidence cluster - Object 23: Area=780.30, Estimated granules=3

=== DE-CLUSTERING SUMMARY ===
Total objects analyzed: 150
Detected clusters: 12
  - High confidence: 8
  - Medium confidence: 4
Single granules: 138
Total estimated granules: 175
Tips for Best Results:

Choose appropriate threshold: Should be slightly above the largest single granule area
Validate visually: Use the generated plots to verify clustering decisions
Consider biology: Adjust maximum granule counts based on biological expectations
Iterative approach: Try different thresholds and compare results

The code is designed to be conservative to avoid overestimating granule numbers, which is generally preferable in quantitative microscopy analysis.
