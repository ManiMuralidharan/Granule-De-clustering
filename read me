This MATLAB code implements an advanced granule de-clustering algorithm for analyzing microscopy data, likely from Imaris software exports. What it does and how to use it.
What This Code Does
The improvedGranuleDeclustering function analyzes microscopy spot data to identify and separate clustered granules from single granules. It's designed to solve a common problem in cell biology where multiple granules appear as single objects due to imaging limitations.
Key Features:

Multi-parameter Analysis: Uses area, shape (circularity), and statistical measures to identify clusters
Confidence Scoring: Classifies clusters as high, medium, or low confidence
Conservative Estimation: Estimates the number of granules in each cluster while avoiding overestimation
Comprehensive Visualization: Creates diagnostic plots to validate results
Data Export: Saves results to Excel files

Algorithm Logic:
The code identifies clusters using three criteria:

Area threshold: Objects larger than the single granule threshold
Area ratio: Objects >1.5x the mean single granule area
Statistical significance: Objects >2 standard deviations above the mean

How to Run the Code
Prerequisites:

MATLAB (with Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox recommended)
Data file (Excel format) with at least an 'Area' column
Optional: 'Circularity' and intensity columns for enhanced analysis

Step-by-Step Instructions:

Prepare Your Data:

Export spot data from Imaris (or similar software) to Excel
Ensure the file contains at least an 'Area' column
Optional columns: 'Circularity', 'Intensity', 'MeanIntensity', 'TotalIntensity'


Save the Code:

Save the code as improvedGranuleDeclustering.m in your MATLAB working directory
